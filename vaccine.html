                What vaccines are out there for COVID-19?
            </h1>
            <p> There are two vaccines available to the public currently. Moderna and Pfizer have developed their own vaccine each requiring two doses. Vaccination is free and typically available in various locations such as health centers, stadiums, big pharmacies, and various locations near you. Each dose is administered on a different day at various times.</p>
            <img id="photo_2" :src="images[1]">
            <h1> Is it safe? </h1>
            <p> Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are FDA approved and have not shown detrimental side effects in the short term post vaccination. However, seeing as the vaccine is new, there is no evidence about the possible long term effects of the vaccine.</p>
            <img id="photo_3" :src="images[2]">
            <h1> How do I get vaccinated? </h1>
            <p> To get vaccinated you can simply walk into any facility near you providing vaccinations. However, you're not guaranteed to get a vaccination through the walk-in method so it is strongly suggested that you simply schedule an appointment online. </p>
